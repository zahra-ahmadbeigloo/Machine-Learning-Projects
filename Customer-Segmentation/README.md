# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on various attributes such as **age, income, debt ratio, and employment years**. By grouping customers into clusters, businesses can tailor marketing strategies and financial offerings based on consumer profiles.  

## Key Insights:  
- Higher-income customers tend to have longer employment histories and lower debt ratios.  
- Debt-to-income ratio varies significantly across customer groups, impacting financial stability.  
- Education levels correlate with spending patterns, affecting financial decision-making.  
- Cluster labels help categorize customers, providing meaningful segmentation insights.  
- 3D scatter plots visually distinguish clusters, making customer patterns easier to interpret.
