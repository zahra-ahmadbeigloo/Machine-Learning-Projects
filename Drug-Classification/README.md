### Predicting Drug Types with Decision Tree Models built with:
- **Python** for backend logic and data processing  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for efficient data handling  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning (**Decision Tree Classifier**)  
- **LabelEncoder** for categorical feature encoding  
- **Train-Test Split** for model validation

# Drug Classification Using Decision Trees 

This project applies **Decision Tree Classification** to predict drug types based on patient attributes like **age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na_to_K)**. It uses entropy-based decision tree learning to classify medications into groups efficiently.  

## Key Insights:  
- Sodium-to-Potassium (Na_to_K) ratio is the strongest predictor of drug type.  
- Blood pressure and cholesterol levels affect medication classification, contributing to model decisions.  
- Decision Tree achieves high accuracy (98.3%), demonstrating its effectiveness in drug classification.  
- Feature encoding improves model performance, allowing categorical values to be processed correctly.  
- Entropy-based Decision Trees visualize classification logic, enabling transparent decision-making.
