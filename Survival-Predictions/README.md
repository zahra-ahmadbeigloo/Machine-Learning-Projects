# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies **Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers** to predict passenger survival based on attributes such as **age, gender, ticket class, family connections, and fare amount**. It incorporates **hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis** to optimize classification performance.  

## Key Insights: 
- Fare amount and passenger class are strong predictors of survival, with first-class passengers having a higher survival rate.  
- Gender is a critical survival factor, as female passengers had significantly higher survival probabilities than males.  
- Random Forest achieves 83% test accuracy, outperforming Logistic Regressionâ€™s 82.68%.  
- Feature preprocessing (scaling and categorical encoding) enhances classification stability, reducing bias.  
- Handling missing data effectively improves model performance, particularly for `age` and `embarked` attributes.
