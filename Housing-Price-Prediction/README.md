# California Housing Price Prediction

This project applies **Random Forest and XGBoost regression models** to predict median house values in California based on census block attributes such as **income levels, population, and household occupancy**. It evaluates model performance and compares results using multiple regression techniques.  

## Key Insights: 
- Median income has the highest correlation with house prices, making it the most important feature for prediction.  
- Random Forest achieves an R² score of 80.5%, whereas XGBoost improves performance to 83.0%, demonstrating higher accuracy.  
- XGBoost trains significantly faster, completing in 0.33 seconds compared to Random Forest’s 20.93 seconds.  
- Feature importance analysis ranks median income, latitude, and average occupancy as top contributors to housing price predictions.  
- Residual analysis reveals prediction errors, helping identify potential model biases.
